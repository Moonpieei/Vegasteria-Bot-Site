# Vegasteria Documentation Site

This is the first project of my return to web development!  
My goal is to learn how to create basic interactive designs using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** while gaining experience.

## Features:
- 🌟 Modern and clean design
- 📱 Responsive (mobile-friendly) structure
- 🛠 Info cards explaining the bot's features
- ✨ Space-themed animated background

---

## Why This Project?
While restarting my project development journey, I wanted to reinforce my foundational skills.  
This project represents both my learning process and preparation for future, larger projects. 🥧

---

## Future Plans:
- 🎞 Adding more complex animations  
- ⚙️ Backend integration (e.g., with Django)
